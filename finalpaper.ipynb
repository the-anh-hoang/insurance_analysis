    "#### 3a. Introduction (Topic Background, Research Questions, and Impact):\n",
    "\n",
    "In the United States, health expenditures have grown dramatically over the past several decades, outpacing general economic growth. National health spending is driven by multiple factors including technological advances, rising costs of treatments, an aging population, and changes in healthcare financing. At the same time, public health outcomes—measured by metrics such as disease-specific mortality—are influenced by a wide range of factors such as medical innovation, public health interventions, and social determinants of health.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our research aims to explore the relationship between these rising health expenditures and the burden of disease, as captured by the IHME Global Burden of Disease (GBD) dataset. Specifically, we ask:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Research Question 1:** How do overall national health expenditures (both in total and per capita) relate to trends in mortality, as measured by IHME data?\n",
    "2. **Research Question 2:** How does the composition of health expenditures—broken down by service types (e.g., hospital care, physician services) and financing sources (e.g., government, private sponsors)—impact mortality from specific diseases?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why These Questions Matter?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Policy Implications:** Both questions have strong implications for healthcare policy. If we find that increased spending is associated with improved mortality outcomes, or that certain types of expenditures are particularly effective, this information can guide future budget allocations and policy reforms.\n",
    "- **Efficiency and Equity:** Investigating the composition of spending can reveal whether resources are being used efficiently and equitably. For example, if public spending in preventive care correlates strongly with lower mortality in chronic diseases, it might suggest that expanding such programs could lead to better outcomes.\n",
    "- **Long-Term Trends:** With healthcare costs rising steadily over the past decades, understanding the relationship between spending and health outcomes is critical. These research questions help to contextualize historical trends and to predict future challenges, especially as the population ages and new medical technologies emerge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, our research questions address both the macroeconomic perspective—how total spending relates to mortality—and the more granular perspective—how the allocation of spending across different services influences specific health outcomes. This dual approach provides a comprehensive understanding of the healthcare spending landscape and its impact on public health.\n",

    "#### 3c. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**i. What datasets are you using?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using the following datasets:\n",
    "- **IHME GBD 2021** dataset (Global Burden of Disease Study), which contains yearly estimates of disease burden and mortality for specific causes in the United States.\n",
    "- **NHE (National Health Expenditure) Tables** from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), including:\n",
    "  - Table 1: Total Expenditures\n",
    "  - Table 2: Expenditures by Type\n",
    "  - Table 3: Source of Funds\n",
    "  - Table 5: Type of Sponsors\n",
    "  - Table 23: Real Dollar Adjustments (inflation-adjusted expenditures)\n",
    "\n",
    "**ii. Why did you choose these particular datasets?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We selected these datasets because they are:\n",
    "- **Authoritative and comprehensive**, coming from trusted sources (IHME and CMS).\n",
    "- **Time-aligned**, providing historical annual data from 1980 to 2023 (with some exceptions).\n",
    "- **Complementary**, allowing us to link mortality data from IHME with financial expenditure patterns from NHE to investigate trends and possible relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "These datasets together provide a rich foundation for analyzing how healthcare spending relates to public health outcomes over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**iii. What data cleaning steps did you perform and why do you think these steps were sufficient?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We performed the following cleaning steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dropped irrelevant or redundant columns** in the IHME dataset (e.g., `location_id`, `age_id`, `sex_name`) that contained only one value or were not meaningful for U.S.-level aggregate analysis.\n",
    "- **Converted year columns to rows** (unpivoted) in NHE tables using pandas `melt()` to standardize formats across all datasets.\n",
    "- **Merged inflation data** from Table 23 to transform nominal expenditures to real 2017-dollar values.\n",
    "- **Dropped tables that lacked necessary temporal range or were duplicative**, such as Table 4 and Table 19.\n",
    "- **Standardized column names** for merging consistency.\n",
    "- **Handled non-numeric symbols** like `' - '` by replacing them with `NaN` and converting relevant columns to numeric types.\n",
    "- **Verified absence of missing values** in critical columns after cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps ensured that all datasets could be reliably joined on the `year` field and used for consistent analysis across all research questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**iv. What are some things people need to be aware of about your data?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The IHME dataset contains mortality estimates (`val`, `upper`, `lower`) expressed as counts, not rates. While useful, they do not adjust for population growth.\n",
    "- **Some NHE tables begin in 1987**, meaning that not all tables cover the full 1980–2023 range. This affects which years can be used in merged analyses.\n",
    "- **Missing or placeholder values like `' - '`** were present in some tables and needed to be replaced with `NaN`.\n",
    "- **National Health Expenditure totals** in the real-dollar tables are aggregates of other rows and should be excluded from comparative category analyses.\n",
    "- A few disease-specific trends from IHME show **unexpected spikes or drops**, which might be due to changes in measurement or classification. These should be interpreted cautiously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the datasets were of high quality, and after cleaning, we were confident in their integrity and usability for the purposes of this research.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3d. Methodology:\n",
    "\n",
    "**i. What methodology did you employ to answer your research questions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer our two research questions, we followed this structured approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Integration and SQL-Based Querying**\n",
    "   - All cleaned and transformed datasets were loaded into a relational SQL database.\n",
    "   - We designed a schema that connects all tables using `year` as the primary linking key.\n",
    "   - SQL was used to:\n",
    "     - Perform joins across datasets.\n",
    "     - Select relevant disease-specific rows.\n",
    "     - Aggregate expenditure totals by year and subcategory.\n",
    "     - Filter and reshape data for further analysis in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Python-Based Visualization and Analysis**\n",
    "   - Python (with pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn) was used to:\n",
    "     - Calculate descriptive statistics.\n",
    "     - Identify skewed distributions and trends.\n",
    "     - Plot time-series trends for diseases and expenditures.\n",
    "     - Compare nominal vs. real dollar expenditures.\n",
    "     - Visualize top-5 expenditure categories and most prevalent diseases.\n",
    "     - Explore potential relationships between expenditures and death counts.\n",
    "   - We also used Python for data wrangling tasks that would be cumbersome in SQL, such as:\n",
    "     - Converting strings to numeric values.\n",
    "     - Plotting disease-specific death trends year-over-year.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Correlation Analysis**\n",
    "   - To explore whether higher spending correlates with reduced mortality (first research question), we merged real-dollar health expenditure data with total death counts from IHME.\n",
    "   - We examined scatter plots and computed Pearson correlation values for an initial assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ii. Why did you choose your particular methodology?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- We chose **SQL** for the majority of the work because:\n",
    "  - The datasets were structured and relational in nature.\n",
    "  - SQL excels at filtering, joining, grouping, and aggregating tabular data efficiently.\n",
    "  - It's a core requirement for this project and enforces discipline in data design and normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We used **Python** for the remaining because:\n",
    "  - It's more expressive and flexible for data cleaning, numerical conversions, and plotting.\n",
    "  - Python's libraries like `pandas` and `matplotlib` make time-series visualizations and ad-hoc analyses much easier.\n",
    "  - Tasks like detecting and replacing placeholder characters (e.g., `' - '`) or drawing grouped plots would be tedious in SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "This SQL-first and Python-assisted approach allowed us to maintain data integrity, leverage the strengths of both tools, and ensure scientific soundness in evaluating trends and relationships."
